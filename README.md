## Ruby on Rails Take Home Interview

The objective of this take home interview project is to develop a movie browsing app. 
You are given 2 endpoints:
- `localhost:3000/movies` - Gives a list of movies with their details.
- `localhost:3000/genres` - Gives a list of movie genre names.
You can see in the repo in `db/db.json` what the responses look like. 

We've added a small server that you will need to run in order to interact with these endpoints. We've also added a script in your package.json file to run the server `"start-api-server": "json-server --watch db/db.json"`

Please make sure to clone this repo. When you are finished please provide a link to the repo so we can take a look.

To get started  
- Run `bin/setup` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn start`
- In a different termimal run `yarn ios` or `yarn android` to launch an emulator

In total that means you'll need 3 termimals. 

Next are the requirements. It will be helpful to read all the requirements before beginning.

1. Create a screen that displays a list of genres.

The endpoint http://localhost/genres is already provided for you.

You can style the list any way that you like. You will need to make sure that each list item has some kind of icon that will later be used to navigate to another screen.

Users should be able to scroll through the genres.

Another thing to note is that the Genres will NEVER change.
